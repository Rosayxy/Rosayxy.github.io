# About
## 作者
Hi there! Rosa is an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I'm also a research intern at NISL-VUL337 group at the Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace, Tsinghua University. My research interests include system security and fuzzing.

As for my hobbies, I play CTFs (mainly pwn) in my spare time. I am currently playing with Redbud, blue-lotus and Blue Water. Sometimes I also play solo (or duo?) at team jiegec (consisting only of me and my boyfriend).

My other interests include reading romance or fiction novels, doing makeup and playing *Honkai: Star Rail*.
